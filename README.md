# newt Examples

Examples for the [newt](https://github.com/tarcisiofischer/newt) project. They are **not** tests.
Each package is a separate example, but all objects are loaded from the ```objects/``` folder.
The name of the package can be ```example_interactive_<name>``` for real time, interactive,
simulations (Where you should be able to move around with mouse + WASD) or
```example_rendered_<name>``` for rendered simulations (Saved as .mp4 video).
